# Discord-Copy-Link

A lightweight browser extension that brings back the "Copy Link" and "Open Link" context menu options to Discord.

Disclaimer: This project is not affiliated with Discord in any way.

## Existing alternative

I didn't realize until after finishing a working version of this project that there is a plugin called "WebContextMenus" for a browser extension called "Vencord" that does the same thing as this extension. The advantage of this extension is that it is very lightweight, but you may want to use Vencord instead if you are interested in other plugins it has or if you want to use an extension that has a larger and more active community of maintainers and contributors.

## Installation

- Clone the repository or download and extract a ZIP from the big green "Code" button.
- Look up "how to manually install \<your browser\> extensions".
  - This should work for Firefox and Chrome. It may work for other browsers.
  - You can also use the "about:debugging" method Firefox to load this as a temporary extension.
  - I will probably put this extension on extension stores (which costs money) if it gets stars on GitHub.
